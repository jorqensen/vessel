# Vessel

My own personal Scoop bucket.

## Usage

Add the bucket to your Scoop installation.

```ps1
scoop bucket add vessel https://github.com/jorqensen/vessel
```

Run the following command, you should see "vessel" listed as a bucket.

```ps1
scoop bucket list
```

Now you can install manifests from this bucket using the Scoop CLI.

```ps1
scoop install [manifest]
```
